 Task: Agent Framework Test Case

Scenario: You are to create an agent workflow capable of generating questions and answers on a specific topic using either Autogen or CrewAI agent frameworks in Python.
Alternatively you can find additional quick insights on the framework chosen on this YouTube channel.

Agents Required:
1. Researcher: Develop ideas for teaching someone new to the subject.
2. Writer: Use the Researcherâ€™s ideas to write a piece of text to explain the topic.
3. Examiner: Craft 2-3 test questions to evaluate understanding of the created text, along with the correct answers. In other words: test whether a student has fully understood the text.
Feel free to use any model from the Ollama model catalogue, as long as it's maximum 7 billion parameters. You could use openhermes.

Submission Requirements:
- Share your work through GitHub, Bitbucket, or another git repository.
- Include a requirements.txt file for any dependencies.
- Ensure your program is compatible with Linux Ubuntu and the latest version of Ollama.
